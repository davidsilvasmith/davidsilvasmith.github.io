Doing sales on a Sunday? I bet you picture me calling people or dropping in on them at their homes?

No! I'm not that kind of guy.

Today I spent most of the day working through [New Sales Simplified](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814431771).

What do I mean working through? While I go through books I like to take action. If I read it and 'get back to it later' that means I'm probably not going to get back to it later.

At the end of this day however I now have these documents:

 - Sales Story (not a story about how we became to be, but why people buy from us and what pains we solve.
 - Sales Strategy
 - Strategic Targets Questions
 - Sales Weapons

I think these documents will help Phil and me close some more deals.
