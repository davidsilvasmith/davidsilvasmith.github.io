title: Cold Emailing is Hard!

This summer I had success building [Startup Grind Lansing](http://www.startupgrindlansing.com) and some success (although not enough) at Cognite Labs.

In both of those successes cold outreach to build sales was critical.

Well I thought they were cold. I had about 1,500 LinkedIn contacts this year. Clearly I'm not talking to all these people on a regular basis.

When I reached out to them this year I considered many of them 'cold'

In highschool I thought I took cold showers. I had the shower on the cold setting and people thought I was crazy.

One day our hot water heater broke. I thought hey no problem - I've been showering cold for years. 

Well when I turned on that shower and couldn't put my whole body in to the icy cold water I found out there was a whole new level of cold.

Well the same thing happened this week.

A few weeks back I purchased a list of 1,000 leads. This week I sent a variety of emails to 400 of those leads.

I found out there is a HUGE difference between someone I met at a conference once and connected on LinkedIn vs. someone I've never met before.

I had **ZERO** responses and **ZERO** link clicks. 

At a .25% response rate I would have had 1 link click.

I now have a new respect for spammers :)
