title: Opportunity or Distraction?

Today I took a phone meeting with a local non-profit about a mobile app.

Going into the call I expected I would refer the app to one of my friends.

However as the call went on I got more excited about the opportunity.

It is an issue I care about AND they have a COOL idea that I think will make an IMPACT.

Wait there's more!

On sales calls I like to talk about budget. Unfortunately mobile apps are never cheap. It is one of the most in demand skill sets in programming and commands a commensurately high bill rate.

So it sounded like their budget was not going to be able to cover the cost of development. Apparently their Executive Director is a genius. He came up with a potential solution where we could retain the intellectual property and build the app for more organizations like theirs!

So this means we might be able to:

 1. Make an awesome app
 2. Make an impact on our local community
 3. Duplicate that to other regions

This idea grabbed me and I spent 8 hours today working on the mockups (in [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/)).

They look HOT :)

So this is either an awesome opportunity OR a distraction.

Actually maybe it is both :)
