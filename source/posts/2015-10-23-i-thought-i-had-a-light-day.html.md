I woke up around 5:45 AM after falling asleep around midnight.

I spent 15 minutes trying to go back to sleep since I'm tired but couldn't.

Since I wrote yesterday:

 - Last night I sent my current partner an email letting him know my future plans regarding the tech I'll be using, the testimonials I'll be using, etc. I don't want him to hear it from somewhere else and be surprised. In that email I also included details for handling other items, the biggest of which is a client we signed this summer who I've been the lead on. I'd like to continue servicing them through my partner's company. I proposed a revenue split for scenarios in which I need someone from his team to do the work and for scenarios in which I need to do the work.
 - The designer I spoke to Wednesday evening said he is interested in coming onboard! He is asking for 33% higher pay than I expected, but I think I'll agree anyways. I think the profit margins will support that pay and he wants to learn about the business.

On deck for today:

 - Responding to around 30 emails I let pile up yesterday.
 - Writing a 200-400 word article for Startup Grind.
 - Migrating the [Vexti website](http://www.vexti.co/) from the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) platform to [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
 - Helping train a potential hire - we interviewed an MSU CSE student last week. He didn't have the skills we needed for him to be productive right away so we offered to put him on a self guided training course for six weeks with a 1 hour meeting with me each week. Today is our first meeting.
 - Happy hour - I plan on attending a happy hour with my current (soon to be former) partner.
 - I'm going to a bitcoin meetup this evening. There are some new Michigan based bitcoiners making some waves and I want to meet them.
 - Oh and I almost forgot I'm having lunch with a bitcoiner.

I thought I had a light day, but looking at all that....

I'd also hoped to migrate my personal site (that you are reading right now) from Jekyll to Middleman. It's ambitious, but we'll see.
