title: Lots of Work on my First Sunday

I didn't get everything done I wanted to yesterday.

I did get my [Vexti website](http://www.vexti.co) launched.

However I didn't get as much done on it as I wanted.

I also spent some time in the Facebook [Next Level Mastermind group](http://www.nextlevelgroupmastermind.com/) I'm in.

I have been afraid to invest money presales. I think that can be good, but it can also be ridiculous. I know I have a challenging day tomorrow and I decided to ask a former colleague for some help with sales.

My plan is to give him access to my LinkedIn contacts and have him reach out with a message asking for a referral.

I also decided to invest (a whopping $7 / month) in Github private repositories. This will allow me to easily let other people help on my website.

The person I hope ends up working with me asked for marketing materials and branding materials. I gave him access to the website sourcecode and it would make my life a lot easier if he surprises me by making some improvements to the website.

I ended up making the birthday party and I got some work done on my new contract (around 1:00 AM) and sent the client an update.

#Today

I woke up feeling good and my client said the work I did looked good.

Today I have a busy day. 

I need to:

 - Do some work for my new client
 - Do some onsite work for a client from my old (as of Friday) partnership.
 - Do some work for [Krajniak Capital Management](http://www.kcmria.net). I have an ownership stake in the businesses and need to deliver a mobile app over the next couple of weeks.

I want to:

 - Update my personal website to use [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
 - Update the Vexti website
 - Add some landing pages to the Vexti website for the sales campaign I'm going to start Monday.
