My Grandpa, Lawrence John Smith, [was honored](http://hastingsreminder.com/former-lake-odessa-elevator-operator-being-honored-p10151-93.htm) May 22nd at the Lake Odessa (where I grew up) Museum by being inducted into the Veteran's Hall of Fame. 

He died when I was four years old. I have fond impressions of him because everyone I spoke with said he was a wonderful man. The one memory I do have of him is sitting on the dock with him while he was fishing.

John Waite gave a moving speech at the induction giving a summary of my grandfather's life, discussing how he met his wife (my grandma), started his business, went off to war, and grew his business.

It was particularly interesting for me to hear the context of what war meant to everyday American citizens back then and to hear about what he went through. John read excerpts from a letter my grandpa had written to my grandma recounting the Battle of the Bulge. He was shot at, shelled, crawling under barbed wire fence, and shooting at enemy soldiers.

He wrote to my grandma "I'll always come home to you." It is hard for me to imagine myself having such conviction and courage under such trying and stressful circumstances.

Here are photos I took at the event.

# My Grandfather's Table

John Waite did a great job putting together two tables with photos, medallions, maps, and other items from my grandfather's World War II service.

## The Ceremony

These photos are from the induction ceremony. There were about 40-50 people. My grandpa must have been a special man.

The man in the green hat was also named Larry. He introduced himself to me after the ceremony and told me about working with my grandpa. He said my grandpa was fair and well liked. This larry learned a lot about business from my grandpa and was able to open his own business a few years later.

## POW Camp

I was surprised to learn there was a prisoner of war camp in Lake Odessa housing 300 German prisoners.
