A new Beginning…

It’s been an interesting three year journey since I started my own company in 2012.

There have been highs, like 2013 where I was semi-retired, had great income, and my investments doubled my net worth.

2014 was a middle ground where I was doing awesome stuff - speaking to congressional policy makers about bitcoin, hanging out with VCs in Silicon valley, and speaking at conferences in exotic locations like Singapore, but it was relatively expensive and my net worth decreased about $250K

2015 has been a rough year for me. My investments have continued to decline and I got into a partnership that didn’t work out like I’d planned.

It was tough, I really liked my business partner and theoretically it seemed like a great match. Unfortunately in practice I wasn’t happy and didn’t feel I was working on the right things or being efficient so we called it quits.

Monday I’m starting off on my own again.

I have pressures 

 - $2k in expenses per month
 - $10K consumer debt I built up over this year that I want to get rid of.
 - I want to spend more time with my son
 - I want to have more fun
 - I want to spend some money (better food, dental, house maintenance, two vacations next year, lasik eye surgery)

I have opportunities

 - awesome tech skills
 - project management skills
 - a big network (although I don't use it effectively)
 - business acumen
 - sales skills (I hope I still have these...)
 - a positive net-worth (although in decline for the past 2 years)

The things I’ve enjoyed over the past 3 years have been:

 - Learning
 - meeting people in the bitcoiners, libertarians, and entrepreneurs
 - speaking at conferences
 - working on efficient websites (mostly [Bitcoin Bulls](http://www.bitcoinbulls.net))
 - working on bitcoin software
 - meeting bitcoiners

I’m looking at two choices:

 1. Something in the bitcoin space - I love doing it but haven't gotten substantial revenue since my arbitrage software. I’ve tried speaking, consulting, software projects, educational websites. 
 
 The challenge with bitcoin is that I'll love the work, but I'll feel guilty about doing the work if it isn't meeting my monthly expenses.
 2. The other thing I'd like to do is help small business owners have websites that wow their customers. No one loves their CMS and I feel like there is a big opportunity in the space, plus I've got a solution 90% there (but I know the last 10% could be just as hard as the first 90% :))
 3. Software development - I’m a great software developer. I like working on interesting problems. I like writing beautiful code, I like exploring new technologies.
 4. Getting paid to learn - I love learning. I’d like to learn more about Blender and Angularjs. Maybe I could get paid to do projects on [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com)


I need to generate revenue so my net worth stops decreasing every month. That makes me feel awful and stressed.




Should I write more posts?

Should I track my time? (to know what the most effective use is)
