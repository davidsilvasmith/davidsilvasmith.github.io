I think I've gotten out of my slump!

I got two proposals done today and I'm feeling good.

I also did some financial planning.

I built a simplified revenue model in Google Drive.

I underbid one of the proposals I delivered, which is particularly funny because [my Fortune article](http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/entrepreneurs-startups-financial-trouble/) discusses the problems with underbidding.

Oh well, I'm excited about the project. I think we'll do an awesome job for the client and have it be a site we can be super proud of.

Back to the financial model - the goal is to understand how I'm going to meet my personal goal of $6K in revenue per month. I can survive on $2K, but at the $6K level I'll be able to splurge a little on entertainment and my son while increasing my net worth each month.

Here is what I built.

In the model I want to support two full time salaries + business expenses.

The model help me quickly realize I am going to have trouble in the support category at the current pricing and that is also the biggest opportunity.

I want to figure out ways I can deliver more value to customers in the support package and get those prices up. That will help build a business where each new customer pays dividends for the life of the account. Ideally I would be able to provide some service that clearly brings in leads or even direct sales...

I have a feeling one solution might be SEO which I have been experimenting with since August.
