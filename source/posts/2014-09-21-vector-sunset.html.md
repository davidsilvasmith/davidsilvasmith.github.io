I made this sunset following this [well written tutorial](http://tutorialgeek.blogspot.com/2013/03/draw-sunset-with-tree-silhouette.html): 
![sunset tree](/images/sunset-tree.png "Sunset tree")

The only part of the tutorial I had the slightest bit of trouble figuring out was the gradient. I realized each image of his tutorial images shows the stops and the values he is using for the gradient stops so I could have then copied it exactly. Initially I thought he was demonstrating various sunsets in his images until he found one he liked.

I deviated from the tutorial a bit:

 * While separating the tree from the background I initially tried Gimp's color -> Threshold tool. That didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but doing it a couple of times for different areas of the image worked pretty well.
 * I made a black rectangle as the background so in my sky gradient I could use a transparency for the last stop instead of black. This enabled me to make my stars have full opacity and have the ones close to the "earth" be dimmer due to the transparency from the sunset gradient.
 * I also used the same technique transparency for the last gradient stop on the ground to give the ground a bit of the color behind it.
 * Ditto the technique for the tree. I used a radial gradient just right of center of the trunk. The first stop was all black and the outer stop was transparent. This caused problems where the trunk overlapped the ground. To fix that I made a copy of the trunk (just the part overlapping the ground and going up a little into the tree) and used a linear gradient from black to transparent to remove all transparency from the trunk.
 * I put a semi-transparent white border on the ground to give the glow effect. It is my least favorite part of the drawing.
