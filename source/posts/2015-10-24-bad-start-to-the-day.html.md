Today isn't a good day.

I'm tired and behind.

I'm just starting my workday at 3PM and I'm somewhat unhappy I decided to begin a contract on Saturday. Although I think I'll be happy about that next week.

## Yesterday

I was too tired to post when I got home around 11:30 last night so I'll do quick recap now.

Yesterday I didn't get the [Vexti website](http://www.vexti.co) as far along as I wanted. It is close, but not done like I'd hoped.

I'm dissapointed I didn't get started on revamping my personal website yesterday. That probably means I won't have it done by Monday and I want to use it for sales collateral.

However I did get the other things on my list done yesterday and had some cool conversations.

I also got an interesting inbound lead via email Thursday and did some work looking into my ability to service the request, the potential budget, as well as trying to get a meeting with the contact next week.

I went to a bitcoin meetup that was a lot of fun. I debated skipping it and it took 6 hours, it would have been nice to spend that time working, but it was really cool hanging out with like-minded, interesting, and curious people.

Oh well...

Last thing on yesterday, my partner (now ex?) had given me a check Monday. I tried to give it back to him Tuesday and he said no I should keep it. I told him we could decide on Friday.

Friday we had a short discussion about it and I opted to cash the check. I didn't feel great about it and I'm not sure why...

Funny enough on my way to the bitcoin meetup Jaime Tardy's podcast was talking about understanding emotions. 

Jaime divulged that she ignored her emotions when she was younger and is now working through them.

I don't often feel emotions and I've been surprised at feeling emotional about leaving this partnership.

## Today

I'd thought I could maybe go tailgating. I'd hoped to finish the Vexti Website and I'd wanted to have quite a bit of work done on my new contract by this time.

Instead I've spent 8 hours today doing a combination of napping, reading about US drone strikes, Facebook, Twitter, and household chores

I've also been invited to a birthday party for my son's mom (I live with her) I feel like I should attend the party. I guess I'll take my laptop...

My todo list is simple today.
Work on the work I've been contracted to do and get the Vexti website live.
