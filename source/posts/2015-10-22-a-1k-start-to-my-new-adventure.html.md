Today started off great with a payment notification for $1,000.

I’ve been worrying about money a lot.

I woke up this morning around 5:30 AM and found a paid invoice in my email account.

$1,000 for work I’ve agreed to do Saturday through Thursday.

The email also said:

>I’m sure there are a ton of other things that we could use your help with after this project.

This is great news, I’ve been stressing about money for 2 years (or my whole life? :)) and I believe I’ll be able to help this client enough to cover all my bills.

Additionally this client is a person I’d love to develop an awesome relationship with and I’ll be doing meaningful work.

Being me I can never be completely satisfied. On the downside of things I’m concerned I won’t be building my business and helping website owners have sites that wow their customers.

I had planned to start sales efforts Monday, although I already have a bunch of meetings noon to 7 PM or so.

I’m annoyed about my Monday already. It is going to be nearly impossible to do work for this client, do all my meetings, and do website sales on Monday.

Knowing me I’ll want to bump the sales since they aren’t tied to a deadline. This risks causing me problems down the road with not having signed deals.

## What do I need to do today?
Yesterday I scheduled lunch with a friend to help me figure out my path forward.

In the evening I had a conversation with a friend that got me clarity on next steps so now I’m unsure how to use this lunch.

Other than that my calendar is clear, although I might be taking Colin to the allergist today and cooking dinner...

I want to finish up getting blog posts migrated for my old company from Hubspot to Middleman.
I’m not sure why I’m doing that work. I have a feeling it will be wasted effort…
I guess because I said I would. Seems like an awful reason.

What I really want to do is put up a middleman website at vexti.co hosted on surge.sh. I want to have that done before Monday. I also want to have my personal website migrated to Middleman before Monday.

We’ll see how today goes...
