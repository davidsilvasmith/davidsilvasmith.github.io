I thought my Monday was going to be horrible, but I felt great at the end of it.

#Yesterday
I did not get a few huge items done. I didn't even work on them.

 - I didn't work on migrating my personal site.
 - I didn't work on my [Vexti website](http://www.vexti.co) and it has some bugs :(
 - I didn't do any prospecting for Vexti.
 - I didn't do any work for my VIP client.

##Why so great?

One of my clients had some big issues with a server migration I was involved in. The test plan didn't cover quite a few scenarios that ended up being big issues. I was happy I was able to hop in and help them quickly resolve their issues as well as be interviewed for [The 2nd Brain Collective Podcast](http://2ndbraincollective.com/), make my Startup Grind Lansing strategic meeting, take my son to the allergist, and get some flowers and a card for his mom Theresa.

Also our Startup Grind strategic meeting was great. Tom Arthur has helped catapult our group to the next level by building an army of volunteers. Yesterday he suggested we use a similar process for following up with our speakers. It is a great idea and I expect it will bear results over the next year. 

Also Josh Pederson also had some great ideas around solving our December party planning + budget issues, and had a great suggestion for adding a key community member to our executive team.

Plus the meeting was finished before 1PM. It is my meeting and I've been going over time which annoys me. Hey it's the little things.

Oh yeah the last great thing that happened yesterday was I found out an article I submitted last week on mistakes young founders make to [Startup Grind](http://www.startupgrind.com) was selected for publication on Fortune magazine. I've been experimenting with SEO tools and it will be interesting to see if this article is more like my Huffington Post mention (no traffic) or my USA Today mention (1.5K hits?).

#Today's List

 1. I hadn't put it on my calendar but looking through my email (I'm behind on emails :() I saw I have a meeting with another prospect at 8:15 this morning. Good thing I saw that!
 2. I've got a phonecall with a prospect and it's a potentially big contract for my nascent company. I think on this call I might try something new - being as helpful as possible.
 3. I'm behind on my VIP contract. I want to put in some extra work there today.

Looking at my list it is nice to see I've got leads coming in and moving forward plus revenue coming in.

Maybe I could coast like this for a while, but I don't plan on coasting this time. I need to amp up the sales efforts - not now though there is too much going on. That will just lead to me feeling awful about what I'm not getting done.

Maybe Friday or Monday.
