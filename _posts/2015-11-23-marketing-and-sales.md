I've been working on my marketing game this year and learning a lot.

I haven't experimented much with marketing.

Today I met with Craig Hardman from [Meadowland Marketing](http://meadowlandmarketing.com).

I'm excited to say he is going to put together a marketing video for me!

I'm hoping this will be a video to put on our website and help drive sales.
