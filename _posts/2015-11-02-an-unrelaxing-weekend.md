This weekend I planned on working, but didn't make any progress.

Instead I spent time hanging out with my son Colin, did some house chores, sleeping a lot (argghhhhh!!), and watched Celebrity Apprentice on YouTube (doh?)

It would have been a much better weekend if I wouldn't have been worried about work.

The biggest thing bugging me is I haven't made progress for my VIP client. I did email him last week offering a refund and he said I could get it to him in a week or two.

I like the work and the client. 

I'm concerned as to why I'm not making progress on the task...

## Today

I need to work on two proposals. One is due tomorrow and I don't have the resourcing flushed out.

I like to have the resources help me estimate the project to reduce the risk of mis-estimation.

Oh well :)

Other than that the only major thing is getting work for the VIP client.
