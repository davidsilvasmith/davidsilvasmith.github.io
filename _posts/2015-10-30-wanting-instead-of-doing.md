title: Wanting Instead of Doing

Yesterday I didn't do much.

I had my meetings (one cancelled on me) I did some sales work, I did some work for one client.

I feel like I wasted the day. I didn't get anything major accomplished. I took a 2.5 hour nap.

I felt so unlike doing work I didn't even share my article that was featured in [Fortune magazine](http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/entrepreneurs-startups-financial-trouble/).

I probably spent some time reading / fooling around on the Internet and I've done the same thing for 3 hours this morning + Wednesday afternoon.

I'm spending time thinking about what I want to do instead of DOING it.

I get into cycles where I feel tired and behind. I got into one of those starting Wednesday. Now it is 10:45 AM. I need to break out of it and get into a good cycle.

Next year I want to take 3 vacations - California, Florida, and North Carolina.

That is going to be difficult if I don't take advantage of each hour I have available each day to make that happen.

I need to do instead of want to do.

##One Big Step
