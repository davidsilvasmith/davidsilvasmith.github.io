I think I'm catching up :)

#Yesterday
I spent half my day working on the client emergency and got them out of the woods. 

It felt AWESOME to be able to help them and to take that huge pressure off. I hate not knowing if I'll be able to fix something or when it will be done.

I had a few phonecalls in the afternoon, took a nap, and tried to catch up on email, and did some work to get resources for the lead that came in Wednesday.

Oh and I spent a few hours playing video games with my son :)

Unfortunately I was too tired to do work for my VIP client :(

I listened to some interesting podcast episodes on [Eventual Millionaire](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eventual-millionaire/id414496714?mt=2). on company building - around customer retention, lead generation, and hiring.

I think that is fast becoming my favorite podcast.

The actionable tips are great!


#Today

I have 4 hours of scheduled meetings today.

 - Helping [KCM](http://www.kcmria.net) with an email problem.
 - Meeting with a friend who is good at marketing. There may be opportunities for us to work together.
 - Meeting with someone who can help me deliver Wednesday's lead to do estimating.
 - A joint venture (partnering with other companies) meeting.

Other than those meetings priority #1 is completing work for VIP client.
