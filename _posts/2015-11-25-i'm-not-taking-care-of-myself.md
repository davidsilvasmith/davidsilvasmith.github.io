I've been really focused on work this year. I haven't been exercising, going to the doctor, going to the dentist, etc.

Two days ago I couldn't get a pair of pants to buckle.

Over the past few years my pants have gotten tighter, but I've been able to get them on. Today it was not working.

I weighed myself today and was shocked to see the scale at 180 lbs. This is the heaviest I've been in my life and sometimes after I eat it looks like I'm pregnant :) Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and that is one of the days I often overeat.

##180! What to Do?

I've been thinking about running each morning for a while now. I'll start that.
