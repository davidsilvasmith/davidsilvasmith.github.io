This evening I had two great meetings.

##First

One was with someone I'd love to work with. He is a designer and I am not. To create websites that wow I really need someone with a designer eye.

This guy is awesome and interested. He is still in school which is perfect for me. This will give me time to test out the website business model without the pressure of needing to support his full time salary.

## Second

I had a meeting with a friend who has a lot more business experience than me. She helped me think through what is going on in my head and how I feel.

Speaking with her helped me clarify that I need to work on the website business instead of the bitcoin business. It might take a year or two before I'm generating an income from bitcoin and knowing myself I'd feel awful every one of those days.

I realized when I'm not increasing my net worth every month it makes it hard for me to enjoy life. 

If I'm at a tailgate, party, etc. I feel guilty about what I'm not doing to try earning money.

It feels silly since I've been working a ton this year and made $5,000, whereas if I was doing consulting work or had a full time job I would have made something like $60K - $130K. So all the time I'm spending 'working' isn't resulting in income :)

For some reason I still don't feel great about the path forward (I always worry about opportunity cost?) But I did get clarity on a path forward and hopefully have someone to help fill my skill gap.
