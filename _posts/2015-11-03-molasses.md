I don't know why but I feel like I'm moving so slowly and I'm tired all the time.

Adding to that my bitcoin investment exploded (doubled) over the past 2 weeks which is distracting. I've made more money in those two weeks than most Americans make in a year.

I still don't have either proposal done and haven't done work for my VIP client...

Today I had a few meetings (1 Startup Grind, 1 prospective partner / lead source, one with a prospect, and I cancelled one (50 ideas to increase your bottom line).

I did make some great progress on one proposal. I was disappointed I didn't deliver it Monday.

#Why so Slow Bro?

I seem to get into these stretches about once a year where I'm tired and not productive. It is super-frustrating and I'm not sure what causes it...

 - Could it be stress from the year piled up? 
 - Could it be not getting outside?
 - Could it be I'm uninspired by what I'm doing?
 - Could it be I don't have non-work plans I'm excited about?
 - Could it be my sleep isn't good?

I don't know, and I have a feeling this will pass without me figuring it out.

I hope it passes soon :)
