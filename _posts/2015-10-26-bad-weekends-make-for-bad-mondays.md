I was tired all weekend and didn't get nearly as much work done as I wanted.

For my sanity I think I'm going to focus on the existing contract work that I have and a couple of sales leads that came in until I get my head above water.

Otherwise I'll feel constantly behind, tired, and disappointed in myself.

The big downside:

 - I won't be working on sales as much as I'd planned, so future me might be upset with the lack of revenue.

#Today's List

 1. Follow up with one of the sales leads that came in and try and get an in person meeting tomorrow instead of a phonecall.
 2. Meet with KCM's owner Todd about the mobile app.
 3. Make a couple of small tweaks to the [Vexti website](http://www.vexti.co)
 3. Work on existing contract work
 4. Startup Grind Lansing meeting and work - I need to figure out how to delegate more. I've been a bottleneck here.
 5. I'm being interviewed on a podcast today.


I woke up feeling good and my client said the work I did looked good.

Today I have a busy day. 

I need to:

 - Do some work for my new client
 - Do some onsite work for a client from my old (as of Friday) partnership.
 - Do some work for [Krajniak Capital Management](http://www.kcmria.net). I have an ownership stake in the businesses and need to deliver a mobile app over the next couple of weeks.

I want to:

 - Update my personal website to use [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
 - Update the Vexti website
 - Add some landing pages to the Vexti website for the sales campaign I'm going to start Monday.
