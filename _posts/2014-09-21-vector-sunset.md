I made this sunset following this [well written tutorial](http://tutorialgeek.blogspot.com/2013/03/draw-sunset-with-tree-silhouette.html): 
![sunset tree](/images/sunset-tree.png "Sunset tree")

The only part of the tutorial I had the slightest bit of trouble figuring out was the gradient. I realized each image shows the stops and the values he is using for the gradient stops so I could have then copied it exactly.

I deviated from the tutorial a bit:

 * I made a black rectangle as the background and in my sky gradient I used a transparency for the last stop. This enabled me to make my stars full opacity and have the ones close to the "earth" be more dim.
 * I also used the same technique transparency for the last gradient stop on the ground to give the ground a bit of the color behind it.
 * Ditto the technique for the tree. I used a radial gradient just right of center of the trunk. The first stop was all black and the outer stop was transparent. This caused problems where the trunk overlapped the ground. To fix that I made a copy of the trunk (just the part overlapping the ground and going up a little into the tree) and used a linear gradient from black to transparent to remove all transparency from the trunk.
 * I put a semi-transparent white border on the ground to give the glow effect. It is my least favorite part of the drawing.
