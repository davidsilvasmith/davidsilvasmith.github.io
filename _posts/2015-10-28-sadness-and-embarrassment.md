It's tough balancing work and sales. I hate being behind...

#Yesterday
I spent the majority of my time working on the client emergency. Unfortunately it still isn't fixed and I didn't spend any time on the VIP client project...

Now I'm getting really backed up.

I did have 3 sales meetings / phonecalls yesterday and all went well. I owe three proposals which is a good thing. Two are websites. One can definitely be on the Vexti platform the other I'm not sure yet...

The third is a mobile project. Not something I particularly want to work on right now, but it is a hot lead and I think I will do a great job for them.

## Sadness
One of the people I want to work with, and who I want help bidding and then executing these projects had a personal tragedy this week.

I have no idea what that is like...

He emailed me yesterday and I wrote:

>wow.

>I have no idea what you are going through...

I am uncomfortable in emotional decisions and feel like I make people feel worse.

The goal of my communication was to let them know I don't understand what they are feeling right now.

Yesterday I was thinking about what I wrote and I hope it doesn't make them feel isolated from me ie. you are in a different group than me...

I haven't used wording like that before. Often I open my big mouth and try to help. I read an article recently posted by one of my friends who lost his wife earlier this year. The gist of the article was to just be there with someone. Not be there for them as people often say but with them.

I am a compassionate empathetic person. I don't think my communications reflect that.

It's an area I'd like to improve.

I think honesty is a good step in that direction.

## Off topic - Pride?

In general I've been more honest this year. About a month ago I was embarrassed to ask a client for a favor. Actually even writing about it pains me. I asked them to make the final payment for a project before we delivered it, which is not what we agreed to in our contract.

Writing that makes me feel awful and I hope I never ask that particular favor again.

I started off the call by saying I'm embarrassed to ask. I don't think they had any idea how embarrassed, how I'd been putting off the call for a day, how my stomach was in a knot, or how that is a rare feeling for me.

I wonder why it was such an embarrassment. 

Theories:

 - I don't like needing things from people?
 - I don't like asking for favors.
 - Fiscal responsibility and finance are areas I've been strong in and asking that particular question bothers me because it shows I'm not handling my finances well.

Outcome:

 - They were happy to pay early (the next day actually) and said they loved working with us.
 - I was happy to do something that put me outside my comfort zone. I've been looking for more of those opportunities this year.


#Today

I'm getting further behind. I really need to wrap this emergency issue and get back to my VIP client.

After getting those two issues done I can get these proposals out next week, and maybe relax for a few hours this weekend :)
