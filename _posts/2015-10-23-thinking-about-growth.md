Today was a great day.

The paid invoice from this morning made me feel good about my financial future.

I finished my last piece of work for my current partnership - migrating our website from [Hubspot](http://www.hubspot.com) to [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

I wrote an article for Startup Grind that is being submitted to Fortune. 

Time is at a premium, but I think it was important to submit the article to get back links to my website. I'm doing some SEO work on [Bitcoin Bulls](http://www.bitcoinbulls.net] and it seems backlinks are very important.

Taking on that work I also decided to update my company website, [Vexti](http://www.vexti.co). The content doesn't reflect what I will be working on and now I plan on spending most of my day tomorrow updating the site.

I had a nice lunch with a friend. Instead of spending the lunch worrying about want to do I was able to relax (haven't done that in a while) and learn more about what is going on in his life.

Today a few things resonated with me while listening to  Jaime Tardy's podcast: eventual Millionaire.

This episode was about [taking businesses with revenue to $10K per month.](http://www.ivoox.com/10k-map-webinar-replay-audios-mp3_rf_7625049_1.html)

The thing that really resonated with me was being 5 people away from being a millionaire.

It dove-tailed with something I heard recently about making an org chart with myself in all the roles and looking to delegate and fill each role.

What are the roles I see myself doing in the next month that I should think about hiring for?

 - Sales
 - Recruiting (hopefully :))
 - A web designer
 - Website Maintenance
 - Competitive Analysis
 - Programming

I also decided on a sales strategy.

I'm going to reach out to my LinkedIn contacts (1,700) with some type of personal message asking for a referral to my target customer.

I will also reach out to the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) founders who I've been working on building a relationship with. 

They are a static site hosting platform and I plan on building static sites.

I'm curious how they are approaching sales and wonder if I can learn from them.

My business partner and I had a good day. He seems happier and in a great groove. That helps me feel good.

I wondered if he felt smothered by me. I asked him and he said no.

I'm feeling good :)
