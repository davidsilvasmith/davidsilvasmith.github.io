Today was a nice day.

I helped JC Reindl, a journalist, with the Detroit Free Press with a [bitcoin article](http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2015/11/08/bitcoin-back-detroit-after-price-pop-and-drop/75224930/) he was writing. He ended up including a few paragraphs about me.

I had hoped for a link to my website [Bitcoin Bulls](http://www.bitcoinbulls.net) or [Vexti](http://www.vexti.co) but didn't get either. In retrospect I didn't ask and he probably isn't a mind reader.

I also laid it out to one of my prospective clients that our CMS platform isn't as polished as I'd like and that we'll be building it out during his project.

I was scared he would want to do the project in another CMS, like WordPress or something, but he seems fine with it and offered to give feedback as an early customer.

That is great news!

On the downside - there are hardly any sales in the pipeline. (2). Cashflow is fine at the moment, but I need to get the existing work I have done and get moving on sales.

Other than that I had a couple of phonecalls and stayed home with my son who was sick. 

One of the phonecalls was with a bitcoin VC I met a few years ago. 

ProTip, do follow ups the same day if possible. I know it is hard. :)
