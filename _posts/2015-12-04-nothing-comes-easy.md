We worked hard and submitted an awesome proposal to a local division of a multi-billion dollar organization.

Unfortunately we received news today that we lost the proposal.

>We appreciate your efforts and know that a lot of work went into your proposal; all of our team members thought it was strong. I am sorry that we were not able to work with you on this project.

That proposal would have been a big win for us, helping win additional projects, and giving us resources to accelerate features on our roadmap.

Nothing comes easy, but it is great we submitted proposal that was competitive with other companies who have been in the business a lot longer.
