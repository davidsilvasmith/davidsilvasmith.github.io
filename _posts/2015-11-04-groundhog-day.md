These articles must be getting boring.

I don't have anything to say I haven't said before because I haven't been getting it done.

Today is about sales and execution.

I'm disappointed I've loaded my calendar up with 3 meetings that will take 4 hours that will contribute to neither sales or execution. Along with drive time it is probably another hour or two.

Thats a lot of hours.

Two of the meetings I should be excited about. They are both with ambitious awesome people who are doers.

They are more experienced in business than me. Maybe they will have some insight into my productivity slump.

Fortunately tomorrow I don't have any meetings. I do try to bunch up meetings on days, but I should make it more conscious.
