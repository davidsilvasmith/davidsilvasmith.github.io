I'm the CTO for [Krajniak Capital Management](http://kcmria.net/).

I have been working on our mobile app for the past month or so.

Today at 4:30 AM I finally got the first version of the app done!

I am meeting our CEO at 8:00 AM to show him the app with all his changes.

This project along with a couple of other open contracts have been weighing on me.

It feels awesome to have this app done for Todd and have one less big thing to worry about.

It was a long night, but it was worth it :)
