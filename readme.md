A Middleman conversion from Jekyll of davidsilvasmith.com.

Blog "landing page" does not function. Trying to get the blog to appear like it does on blog.davidsilvasmith.com. The posts are there, however they need to be accessed individually at their own URLs found in the site map.

CNAME does not point to the correct site. DNS needs to be configured or something. I just tried it for testing.
